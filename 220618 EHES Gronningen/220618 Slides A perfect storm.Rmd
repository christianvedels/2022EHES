# Overview
.pull-left[
- In 1825 the Agger isthmus* broke - a very natural, natural experiment
- What is the effect of infrastructure?
- **Answer**: Small initial effect boosted by secondary infrastructure

### Outline
- The argument (secondary infrastructure)  
- The history 
- The data and results

# The argument
1. The canal caused lots of trade but only modest immediate population growth.  
2. The new natural harbours did not have enough capacity.  
3. Strong effects when secondary infrastructure emerged 
4. This pattern might explain why market access estimates are generally inflated beyond theoretical predictions (Redding & Turner, 2015)

### External('ish) validity
- The previous canal in the same location silted up in the 1100s
- The same (but reverse) effect is observed  
- Same shock, different institutions, economy, everything else 
- Informal ICP-application (Peters et al, 2016) or 'Environmental Variables' approach to causality

# Contribution 
.pull-left[
- Does infrastructure promote regional development? (Fogel, 1964; Donalson & Hornbeck, 2016; etc.)
- Does trade cause growth? (Frankel & Romer, 1999; Feyrer, 2021)
- Fundamental determinants of economic wealth: *Institutions or geography?* 
- Pragmatically: Infrastructure is expensive

**Why this case?**: 
- Uniquely well-identified exogenous variation in trade-enabling infrastructure.

## Timeline:

#### Pre-event: 
- Pre-history: Settlements established in key *fjord* locations

# Empirical strategy
#### What will be demonstrated:
  + The canal caused trade 
  + Trade caused growth in population and industry 
  + The take-off of trade is timed with secondary infrastructure*
  + The same (but reverse) effect was observed after the 1100s*
  
#### Approach:
Event studies of the form:
$$y_{it} = exp(Treatment_i \times Year_t \beta_t + FE + \varepsilon_{it})$$
Can be estimated by OLS on $log(y_{it})$ or Poission 

Treament is:
- Being in a relevant region, or
- Improved market access after the breach

# Testing the mechanism

**Ideal case:** Market Access for all secondary infrastructure 
#### Preliminary alternative
- Empirical prediction: 
  + *If secondary infrastructure becomes important the market access of initial shock should become relatively less important*

Regression: 
$$log(Pop\:dens_{it})=West_{i}\times\Delta\log(MA)_i\times Year_t \beta_{tl} + FE + \varepsilon_{it}$$

- *Dose response curve: Effect of MA within West Limfjord region*
- This shows how important MA was for population growth
